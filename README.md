# WHACK-A-MOLE

Whac-A-Mole Web Game with Arduino Integration and SQL Data Storage


# Introduction
Welcome to our Whac-A-Mole web game project, created by a team of talented students! This classic arcade game has been given a modern touch, combining Arduino integration and SQL data storage to offer an immersive gaming experience. Test your reflexes, have fun, and aim for the top spot on the leaderboard!

# Game Overview
In Whac-A-Mole, players must be quick on their feet as moles pop up randomly from their hiding spots. Use the corresponding buttons on the Arduino to whack as many moles as possible and earn points. The game keeps track of players' scores in an SQL database, providing a competitive edge.

# Key Features
Arduino Interaction: Engage with the game physically by using the Arduino buttons to whack the moles. The tactile feedback adds to the enjoyment.

Fast-Paced Gameplay: Sharpen your reflexes and hand-eye coordination as you try to hit the moles before they disappear.

Real-time Score Tracking: Your progress is instantly recorded and stored in the SQL database, allowing you to monitor your performance.

Global Leaderboard: Compete with players worldwide and see how your scores compare on the global leaderboard.

# Technical Aspects
Our game utilizes a robust SQL data structure for efficient data storage of player scores and usernames. The Arduino integration ensures seamless communication between the physical buttons and the web interface.
